Changes in this repo have been made to his original work, all base credit goes to him, additional scripts etc can be found on his gitrepo's @ https://github.com/Tudi/Descent-core I have the original site design with graphics and sections of the old character table, I am personally still in the progress of going through corrupted data and fixing issues with it all.
